The engagement is complete. Run the benchmark scorer and produce a full report.

1. Run score.py against the engagement directory:
   ```
   python C:/Users/Hello/Repos/pends/benchmark/score.py <ENG_DIR>
   ```

2. Based on the score and the engagement evidence, write a benchmark report to
   `<ENG_DIR>/evidence/reporting/benchmark-report.md` covering:

   - **Executive Summary** — total findings confirmed vs missed, PTT completion
   - **Coverage Breakdown** — per-challenge table: ID, category, status (Confirmed/Touched/Not Tested), evidence file
   - **Compliance Assessment** — walkthrough violations if any, guard bypass detection
   - **False Positives** — any findings scored as Confirmed that lack proof quality
   - **Process Notes** — what worked, what didn't, guard friction points
   - **Recommendations** — prompt improvements, profile config changes, tooling gaps

3. Copy the raw scorer output into an appendix at the bottom of the report.

Format the report as a professional pentest benchmark deliverable — no self-congratulation,
just the data and analysis.
